👋🏽 Hello there 

This is a practice that I made with react to improve my skills:

- useContext hook
- useMemo hook
- Custom hooks
- Fetch data from api using debounce

And I wanted to share with you this practice.

This practice was inspired by 

[https://github.com/midudev](https://github.com/midudev)

In order to get the project working create a .env file and add this property
VITE_OMDBAPI_KEY=[api-key]

You can get the api key here https://www.omdbapi.com, it's easy to get just put an email and you'll receive the code
